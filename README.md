# twitchPlus
### Highlights
TwitchPlus is a web application to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations. It implemented RESTful APIs using Java servlets, retrieved real Twitch resources using Twitch API, and stored data in MySQL. Several recommendation algorithms for game information extraction from Twitch resources have been explored.
And a web page with user-friendly experience using React and Ant Design is provided. Still working on deploying the service to Amazon Web Service EC2 for better stability right now.

This is the repo of back end code.
